Rigid Mechanisms
================

We define a rigid mechanism as a finite number of rigid bodies interconnected by ideal joints.

Ideal Joints
============

An ideal joint is a kinematic restriction of the allowed relative twist of two rigid bodies `i` and `j` to a linear subspace of dimension `k`, where the relative motion of the bodies is described by two sets of states, namely

- a matrix `\GPos`, parameterizing the relative configuration as `\H_{01} = \H_{01}(\GPos)`,
- a vector `\GVel \in \Real{k}`, parameterizing the relative twist as `\twist[1]_{1/0} = X(\GPos) \GVel`

where `X(\GPos)` depends smoothly on `\GPos` and `\nu = V_\GPos(\dot{\GPos})` with `V_\GPos` invertible and linear in `\dot{\GPos}`. Furthermore, there exists a mapping `F_\GPos : \Real{k} \rightarrow \GPosSet`.

Implementation
==============

Several ideal joints are already implemented:

- :class:`RzJoint` for hinge joints,
- :class:`RzRyJoint`, :class:`RyRxJoint` and :class:`RzRxJoint` for cardan joints,
- :class:`RzRyRxJoint` for ball and socket joints,
- :class:`FreeJoint` for "free" joints, that do not constrain the relative motion.

Let's take the example of an hinge joint, it has 1 dof, and may be parametrized by the angle `q` and its derivative `\dot{q}`. Here we create a joint, with angle of 60 degrees and rotational velocity of 2 radians per second.

.. doctest::

  >>> from arboris.all import *
  >>> j = joints.RzJoint(gpos = 3.14/3, gvel = 2.)
  >>> j.ndof
  1
  >>> j.gpos
  array([ 1.04666667])
  >>> j.gvel
  array([ 2.])

The relative configuration corresponding to this joint is defined by the homogeneous `\H_{01}` is given by ``pose()``

.. math::

  \H_{rn} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  cos(q) & -sin(q) & 0 & 0\\
  sin(q) &  cos(q) & 0 & 0\\
  0      &  0      & 1 & 0\\
  0      &  0      & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}

.. doctest::

  >>> j.pose
  array([[ 0.50045969, -0.86575984,  0.        ,  0.        ],
         [ 0.86575984,  0.50045969,  0.        ,  0.        ],
         [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  1.        ,  0.        ],
         [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  1.        ]])

Its inverse, `\H_{10} = \H_{01}^{-1}` is given by ``ipose``

.. doctest::

  >>> j.ipose
  array([[ 0.50045969,  0.86575984,  0.        ,  0.        ],
         [-0.86575984,  0.50045969,  0.        ,  0.        ],
         [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  1.        ,  0.        ],
         [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.        ,  1.        ]])

Similarly, the relative twist `\twist[1]_{1/0}` is given by ``twist`` and its inverse by ``itwist``

.. doctest::

  >>> j.twist
  array([ 0.,  0.,  2.,  0.,  0.,  0.])
  >>> j.itwist
  array([-0., -0., -2., -0., -0., -0.])

Eventually, the `X(\GPos)` matrix, which we (perhaps improperly) call
jacobian, is given by ``jacobian``

.. doctest::

  >>> j.jacobian
  array([[ 0.],
         [ 0.],
         [ 1.],
         [ 0.],
         [ 0.],
         [ 0.]])

One can notice that

.. doctest::

  >>> all(j.twist == dot(j.jacobian, j.gvel))
  True

as expected.

Mechanisms
==========

Joints an bodies are interconnected in a tree-like structure, whose nodes are the bodies and edges are the joints. More precisely, a joint is connected between two *frames*, each belonging to a different body.
